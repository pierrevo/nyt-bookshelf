Visualization of the New York Times Best Books

This project is data visualization of the New York Times Best Books from 1996 to 2016.

Live demo is [here](https://dash-casual.herokuapp.com/).

# Data Generation
Data comes from scrapping NYTimes articles on best books at the end of each year. The python scripts allow you to generate a dataset, including book and author information from Goodreads, and best seller information using NYTimes books API. 

# Webapp
The actual visualization work, developed with Dash, requires no serious framework or data bindings.
